    <h1><b>NBA HEIGHT CASE STUDY</b></h1>
    <p class="text">    
      I am a big time basketball fan, while I don’t sit down to watch every NBA
      or college game, I always do explore the game statistics online after the
      games end. Basketball has always been an interest of mine, but I never was
      too successful in the playing side for two reasons: I am average in terms
      of my athleticism, and more importantly, my height. I am 5 '10, which is
      less than ideal for becoming a good basketball player. Everyone knows that
      in order to become an NBA player–aside from a few exceptions–being tall is
      very helpful. But is it possible to be too tall for the NBA? At what point
      does height turn from an advantage to a detriment? And are there
      significant relationships between height and other recorded statistics?

    <h3>Field Goal Percentage (since 1997 season)</h3>
    <p class="text">
      We begin by exploring the most basic statistic in the NBA, field goal
      percentage. Field goal percentage is a good way to understand a players
      general efficiency at scoring the basketball. Field goal percentage is
      measured by dividing made field goals by total field goals attempted, (If
      Lebron James shoots 23 shots in one game and makes 12, his field goal
      percentage is 52.17%). 
      <br>
      <img src="NBAHeightCaseStudy/images/BRON_01.png" width="100%" height="300px" alt="img. not found :("/> 
      <br/>
      As is evident in the interactive graph, there is correlation
      between height and total field goal percentage. However, this data is
      misleading because it does not take into account the fact that a made
      three-point field goal is worth more than a made two-point field goal.
      Without this knowledge, we would be led to believe simply that “height is
      everything”, but that is not the case. While someone who is 6 '10 is going
      to generally score at a higher rate close to the basket compared to
      someone who is only 5' 10, that does not mean that height is everything.
      But height was everything before the 3 point line was introduced in 1979.
      Before this time it was unheard of to find someone who was dominant and
      not also a giant as well. In those times height ruled the league, all-time
      players like Wilt Chamberlain (6'10), Bill Russel (7’1), and George Mikan
      (6'10) dominated and experienced an entire career before the three point
      shot even existed. This new three point shot would go on to change the
      game and allow hall of fame caliber players like Stephen Curry (6’3), Ray
      Allen (6’5), and Steve Nash (6’3) to make a huge impact on the court,
      despite their relatively small stature.

    <h3>The Three Pointer vs. The Two Pointer (Since 1997 season)</h3>
    <p class="text">
      Continuing on, we take a look at the seemingly steady increase in 3 point
      attempts over the past 25 seasons. As is evident, players are attempting
      more and more 3‘s as the years go on. What is the reason for this trend?
      Is it a result of analytics?. If a 3 pointer is worth 3 points, then that
      means that it is worth 50% more than a 2 pointer. Why is this important?
      Well, if a team is able to make 3 pointers with at least ⅔ of the
      percentage that they make 2 pointers, then they would be better off s
      hooting 3’s as they are gaining more points per shot attempt, and thus
      higher efficiency. For example, if Stephen Curry shoots on average shoots
      42% from 3, and 60% from 2, then he would be better off shooting more 3’s
      than 2’s because 42% of 3 (1.26) is higher than 60% of 2 (1.20), thus
      yielding more points per attempt. Now, how does this relate to height?
    </p>
    <div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1669826077115' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Average 3 Point Percentage by Height ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;CA&#47;CAvg_3pt&#47;CAvg_3pt&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='CAvg_3pt&#47;CAvg_3pt' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;CA&#47;CAvg_3pt&#47;CAvg_3pt&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1669826077115');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='450px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>    <p class="text">
      As was mentioned previously, shorter players could not really compete
      before the three point line was added. But with its addition, it grants
      shorter players the ability to make an impact on the court. But this still
      doesn’t fully explain why shorter players shoot 3’s better on average than
      taller players. If the 3 point shot is so valuable in today’s game, then
      why aren’t taller players shooting the 3 at the same efficiency as shorter
      players? Lets go back to middle school basketball. You’re a coach, you
      have 5 kids who are 4’8, 4’9, 4’11, 5’3, and 5’8. Who are you putting in
      at center? Exactly. That 5’8 kid will forever be stuck down low under the
      rim grabbing rebounds, never being taught to develop any shooting or ball
      handling skills simply because he was the tall early on. The tall kid will
      focus on working on skills that play off of their height advantage
      (rebounding, blocks, post-scoring). With this height advantage also comes
      the obvious trend of a higher scoring rate on 2 point attempts for taller
      players.

    Now of course this is just an example, but the point is that a taller
      player doesn’t work on their jumpshot that much because they simply don’t
      need to, they can get by with the natural advantage that is their height.
      In order for a 6’0 player to make it to the NBA, they need to practice
      non-height related skills like passing, shooting, and ball handling.
