    <h1><b>NBA HEIGHT CASE STUDY</b></h1>
    <p class="text">    
      I am a big time basketball fan, while I don’t sit down to watch every NBA
      or college game, I always do explore the game statistics online after the
      games end. Basketball has always been an interest of mine, but I never was
      too successful in the playing side for two reasons: I am average in terms
      of my athleticism, and more importantly, my height. I am 5 '10, which is
      less than ideal for becoming a good basketball player. Everyone knows that
      in order to become an NBA player–aside from a few exceptions–being tall is
      very helpful. But is it possible to be too tall for the NBA? At what point
      does height turn from an advantage to a detriment? And are there
      significant relationships between height and other recorded statistics?

    <h3>Field Goal Percentage and Height</h3>
    <p class="text">
      We begin by exploring the most basic statistic in the NBA, field goal
      percentage. Field goal percentage is a good way to understand a players
      general efficiency at scoring the basketball. Field goal percentage is
      measured by dividing made field goals by total field goals attempted, (If
      Lebron James shoots 23 shots in one game and makes 12, his field goal
      percentage is 52.17%). 
      <img src="BRON_04.png" width="100%" height="100%" alt="img. not found :("/> 
      As is evident in the interactive graph, there is correlation
      between height and total field goal percentage. However, this data is
      misleading because it does not take into account the fact that a made
      three-point field goal is worth more than a made two-point field goal.
      Without this knowledge, we would be led to believe simply that “height is
      everything”, but that is not the case. While someone who is 6 '10 is going
      to generally score at a higher rate close to the basket compared to
      someone who is only 5' 10, that does not mean that height is everything.
      But height was everything before the 3 point line was introduced in 1979.
      Before this time it was unheard of to find someone who was dominant and
      not also a giant as well. In those times height ruled the league, all-time
      players like Wilt Chamberlain (6'10), Bill Russell (7’1), and George Mikan
      (6'10) dominated and experienced an entire career before the three point
      shot even existed. 
      <br>
      <img src="6PLAYERS_02.png" width="100%" height="100%" alt="img. not found :("/> 
      <br>
      This new three point shot would go on to change the
      game and allow hall of fame caliber players like Stephen Curry (6’3), Ray
      Allen (6’5), and Steve Nash (6’3) to make a huge impact on the court,
      despite their relatively small stature.

    <h3>The Three Pointer vs. The Two Pointer</h3>

    <p class="text">
        Continuing on, we take a look at the seemingly steady increase in 3 point 
        attempts over the  past 25 seasons. As is evident, players are attempting 
        more and more 3‘s as the years go on. What is the reason for this trend? 
        Is it a result of analytics?. Well if a 3 pointer is worth 3 points, then 
        that means that it is worth 50% more than a 2 pointer. Why is this important? 
        Well, if a team is able to make 3 pointers with at least ⅔ of the percentage 
        that they make 2 pointers, then they would be better off shooting 3’s as they 
        are gaining more points per shot attempt, and thus higher efficiency. For example, 
        if Stephen Curry shoots 43% from 3 on (6/14), and 60% from 2 (9/15), then he 
        would be more efficient shooting 3’s than 2’s because 43% of 3 (1.29) is 
        higher than 60% of 2 (1.20), thus yielding more points per attempt. In this 
        example, Curry is making 3 pointers with at least ⅔ the percentage he is making 
        2 pointers. 
        <br>
        <img src="Curry_02.png" width="100%" height="100%" alt="img. not found :("/> 
        <br/>
        An offensive possession where you score an average of 1.29 points per possession 
        as compared to 1.2 points per possession yields 7.5% or .09 more points per possession.
        While that does not sound like much, teams are always searching for ways to win more games,
        and analyzing a certain metric such as the value of a 3 vs a 2 can help to win more games.
        There are 82 games in a regular NBA season, it is a grind, and understanding how to be more 
        efficient can be the potential difference between making the playoffs and missing them
        Now, how does this relate to height?

      As was mentioned previously, shorter players could not really compete
      before the three point line was added. But with its addition, it grants
      shorter players the ability to make an impact on the court. But this still
      doesn’t fully explain why shorter players shoot 3’s better on average than
      taller players. If the 3 point shot is so valuable in today’s game, then
      why aren’t taller players shooting the 3 at the same efficiency as shorter
      players? Well lets go back to middle school basketball. You’re a coach, you
      have 5 kids who are 4’8, 4’9, 4’11, 5’3, and 5’8. Who are you putting in
      at center? Exactly. That 5’8 kid will forever be stuck down low under the
      rim grabbing rebounds, never being taught to develop any shooting or ball
      handling skills simply because they were the tall one on the team early on. 
      The tall kid will focus on working on skills that play off of their height 
      advantage (rebounding, blocks, post-scoring). With this height advantage also 
      comes the obvious trend of a higher scoring rate on 2 point attempts for taller
      players. When the average height of an NBA player is 6'6 who would have an easier
      time scoring close to the rim where the tall players stay, the 6'0 point guard or 
      the 6'11 center? Exactly.

    Now of course this is just an example, but the point is that a taller
      player doesn’t work on their jumpshot that much because they simply don’t
      need to, they can get by with the natural advantage that is their height.
      In order for a 6’0 player to make it to the NBA, they need to practice
      non-height related skills like passing, shooting, and ball handling. It is 
      human nature to take the path of least resistance. Why would a player who is 8 
      inches taller than everyone work on shooting 3's? They can get by just fine with 
      their natural height advantage.
